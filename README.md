# TraDetIONS

Transposon detection in Oxford Nanopore Sequencing data

Created by PÃ¤ivi Nummi

Example data HG002 from https://human-pangenomics.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=submissions/0CB931D5-AE0C-4187-8BD8-B3A9C9BFDADE--UCSC_HG002_R1041_Duplex_Dorado/Dorado_v0.1.1/

TraDetIONS uses SVs called by Sniffles and merged with Survivor. Other dependencies are Racon and conda environment environment.yml.

INSTALL:

git clone https://github.com/panummi/TraDetIONS.git


EXAMPLE RUN:

prepairing svs:

sniffles --vcf {output} --mapped_reads {input}
        --threads {threads} "
        --min_support 2 "
        --min_length  10 "
        --num_reads_report 3 "
        --min_seq_size 1000
        --genotype  --cluster --report_seq



Get TEs:

bash detect_TE.sh tradetions_repo_path survivor.vcf /repepat/masker/data/hg38reps.fa data/sample.txt outputdir reference_genome.fasta racon_path TE_merge.tsv

Output will be in output/TE/*
and contain fasta file for insertions sequences, bed file for annotation of the sequences and vcf file for the variants.

TraDetIONS might overnight on HPC cluster
